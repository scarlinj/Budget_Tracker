Welcome to the Budget Tracker!  

## About

Use this simple app to track your income and expenses in the cloud.  Add funds and subtract them as needed.

On the homepage, you will see a blank graph.  Type your expenses at the top and add to the database.  The website will save this to track your expenses.
Try going offline!

## Features

## Usage
